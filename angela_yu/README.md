### Note:

I am taking Angela Yu's #100DaysOfPython challenge which is simply #100DaysOfCode in Python. And I upload the funny projects here. Since I got nothing else to do when I'm super suicidal. Whatever.

#### Day04: Rock, Scissors, Paper game
    You can find it in this folder under *rock_scisors_paper.py* file.
